This is my feeble attempt to build an Xcode 5.1 project with OpenGL 4.0 on OSX 10.9.2

Since the first chapter doesn't generate anything that does anything interesting, I only built this
project after bashing my head against the wall trying to get an OpenGL application to run.

The Apple documentation as of 2014-03-30 is out of date, incomplete, and pretty terrible.

I'm posting this XCode project free for anyone to use and modify because: why should anyone else damage their
cranial regions with the headbashing and the facepalming.

Please, use it in good health. I disclaim all liability and make no warrantees. Use at your own risk. Blabbably blah.


This XCode project (for me at least) is fully compatible with the second chapter of the most excellent OpenGL Book located at:
http://openglbook.com/the-book/

Chapter 2 is secifially at: http://openglbook.com/the-book/chapter-2-vertices-and-shapes/

I'm presently at chapter 2 myself. I may update this project to include tags for the completion of other chapters as I move through the book.
